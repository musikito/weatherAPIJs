# Show the Local Weather

The weather app will be a single page app with the following features:

* I can see the weather in my current location.
* I can see a different icon (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert, cloudy, rainy) depending on the weather.
* I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

You will need to get your API key from:
* [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)
* ![OpenWeather](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/OpenWeatherMap_logo.png)

# Prerequisites
